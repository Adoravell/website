## Is Kotatsu available for iOS/iPadOS?
There is no iOS or iPadOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps.

Any app proclaiming to be "**Kotatsu for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## Can I read light novels?
**Kotatsu** can't read light novels; it's an image parser, not a text parser.

## Can I stream anime?
**Kotatsu** isn't designed for anime streaming.

Projects using the **Kotatsu** name for anime streaming aren't affiliated with the main project.
